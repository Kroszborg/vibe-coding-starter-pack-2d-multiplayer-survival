## ‚ö° Quick Local Setup

For experienced users familiar with Node.js, Rust, and SpacetimeDB. See detailed sections below for troubleshooting or authentication specifics.

**0. Install SpacetimeDB CLI:**
Follow the instructions for your OS: [https://spacetimedb.com/install](https://spacetimedb.com/install)
(e.g., `curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh` on macOS/Linux)

**1. Clone & Install Client Deps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeloSlav/vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival.git
cd vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival
npm install
```

**2. Setup & Run Auth Server (Terminal 1):**
```bash
# Ensure OpenSSL is installed (https://www.openssl.org/source/)

# From the project root directory, create a 'keys' directory:
mkdir keys

# Generate RSA private and public key files inside the 'keys' directory:
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem

# Navigate to the auth server directory and run it:
cd auth-server-openauth/
npm install
npm start
# Keep this terminal running (Auth Server on http://localhost:4001)
```

**3. Run SpacetimeDB Server (Terminal 2):**
```bash
# In project root directory
spacetime start
# Keep this terminal running (SpacetimeDB Server)
```

**4. Publish Server & Generate Bindings (Terminal 3):**
```bash
cd server/
# Optional: Clean previous DB state if needed
# spacetime delete vibe-survival-game
spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .
cd ..
```

**5. Run Client Dev Server (Terminal 3 or 4):**
```bash
# In project root directory
npm run dev
# Access game at http://localhost:3008 (or similar)
```
*   **For Multiplayer Testing:** Open a **new terminal** in the project root and run `npm run dev` again. The second client will likely open on a different port (e.g., 3009). Open this URL in a separate browser tab or window.

**Updating Server Code:**
*   **Logic Change Only:** `cd server && spacetime publish vibe-survival-game`
*   **Schema Change (Tables/Reducers):**
    1.  `(Optional but Recommended)` `spacetime delete vibe-survival-game` (Run *before* publish to prevent schema conflicts).
    2.  `cd server`
    3.  `spacetime publish vibe-survival-game`
    4.  `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated --project-path .`
    5.  `cd ..`

## üîê Authentication Setup

This project implements user authentication using a custom Node.js authentication server built with OpenAuthJS and Hono, bridged to SpacetimeDB via standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWTs.

**Approach:**

1.  **Client:** Initiates an OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, manually constructing the `/authorize` URL for the custom auth server and specifying `acr_values=pwd` to request the password flow.
2.  **Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):** A Node.js/Hono server that:
    *   Intercepts the `/authorize` request.
    *   If `acr_values=pwd`, redirects the user to custom HTML login/registration forms, forwarding OIDC parameters (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, `code_challenge`, etc.).
    *   Handles POST submissions from these forms, verifying user credentials against a local user store (`data/users.json`).
    *   On successful login/registration, generates a one-time authorization `code` and stores it along with the user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Redirects the user back to the client's specified `redirect_uri` with the `code` and `state`.
3.  **Client:** Receives the redirect at its `/callback` URI, extracts the `code`.
4.  **Client:** Makes a `fetch` POST request to the auth server's custom `/token` endpoint, sending the `code`, PKCE `code_verifier`, `client_id`, and `redirect_uri`.
5.  **Auth Server (`/token`):**
    *   Receives the code exchange request.
    *   Looks up the code, retrieves the associated user ID and PKCE challenge.
    *   Verifies the `code_verifier` against the stored `code_challenge`.
    *   If valid, mints a new JWT `id_token` and `access_token`, signed using a **private RSA key** (RS256 algorithm).
    *   Returns the tokens to the client.
6.  **Client:** Receives the tokens, stores the `id_token` (used as the `spacetimeToken`).
7.  **Client:** Connects to the main SpacetimeDB game server (`server/`) using the `id_token`.
8.  **SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Configured with the `issuer` URL of the auth server.
    *   Fetches the OIDC discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) and then the public keys (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) from the auth server.
    *   Verifies the `id_token`'s signature using the fetched public key and validates the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims.
    *   Grants the connection access based on the identity (`sub` claim) in the validated token.

This approach uses standard OIDC practices with asymmetric key signing (RS256), allowing SpacetimeDB to securely verify tokens without needing a shared secret.

### Running Authentication Locally

To get authentication working during local development, follow these steps:

1.  **Generate RSA Keys:** You need an RSA key pair for signing and verifying tokens. Use OpenSSL:
    *   Open a terminal in the **project root** directory.
    *   Run the following commands:
        ```bash
        # Create a directory for keys if it doesn't exist
        mkdir keys
        # Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
        # Extract the public key from the private key
        openssl rsa -pubout -in keys/private.pem -out keys/public.pem
        ```
    *   This creates `keys/private.pem` (keep secret, used by auth server) and `keys/public.pem` (used for verification).
    *   **Important:** The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent these keys from being committed to Git.

2.  **Configure Auth Server (`auth-server-openauth/`):**
    *   No `.env` file is strictly required for basic local operation, as defaults are set in `index.ts`.
    *   The server automatically loads `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` for signing tokens and serving the JWKS endpoint.
    *   It manages user data in `data/users.json` (which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist). The `.gitignore` also prevents this file from being committed.

3.  **Run Auth Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `auth-server-openauth/` directory.
    *   Run `npm install` if you haven't already.
    *   Run `npm start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running. You should see `üöÄ Auth server ‚Üí http://localhost:4001`. Logs for authentication steps will appear here.

4.  **Configure SpacetimeDB Server (`server/data/config.toml`):**
    *   Ensure the `server/data/config.toml` file has the following `[auth]` configuration to trust your auth server:
        ```toml
        [auth]
        [[identity_provider]]
        type     = "oidc"
        issuer   = "http://localhost:4001"       # URL of our OpenAuth server
        jwks_uri = "http://localhost:4001/.well-known/jwks.json" # Explicitly point to the JWKS endpoint
        audience = "vibe-survival-game-client" # Must match 'aud' claim in tokens
        ```

5.  **Run Main SpacetimeDB Server (`server/`):**
    *   Open a **separate terminal**.
    *   Run `spacetime start`.
    *   Keep this terminal running.

6.  **Client Configuration:** No changes are needed in the client code. `AuthContext.tsx` is configured to use the auth server at `http://localhost:4001`.

7.  **Run Client:**
    *   Open a terminal in the project **root** directory.
    *   Run `npm run dev`.

Now, when you sign in via the client's login screen, the full authentication flow using your custom OpenAuthJS server and RS256 keys should execute.

### Production Deployment

*   **Auth Server:** Deploy the `auth-server-openauth` Node.js application to a hosting provider. Ensure the `keys/private.pem` and `keys/public.pem` files are securely deployed alongside the application (or manage keys via environment variables/secrets management if your host supports it). Ensure it's served over HTTPS.
*   **Client:** Update `AUTH_SERVER_URL` in `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to point to your *deployed* auth server URL (using HTTPS).
*   **SpacetimeDB:** Configure your SpacetimeDB Maincloud/Enterprise instance with the *production* `issuer` and `jwks_uri` of your deployed auth server, and the correct `audience`.

### Limitations & Future Improvements

*   **Basic Forms:** The login/register forms served by the auth server are very basic HTML. They could be enhanced or replaced with a proper frontend framework if desired.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling in the manual auth routes could be more user-friendly.
*   **No Refresh Token Handling:** This setup doesn't implement refresh tokens. If the `id_token` expires, the user would need to log in again.

## üìú Cursor Rules & Code Maintainability

### Cursor Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

This project utilizes [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)'s AI features, including **Rules**, to aid development. Rules are markdown files (`.mdc`) that provide context and guidelines to the AI assistant.
*   `guide.mdc`: Contains general architectural guidelines, technology choices, and development workflow information.
*   `resources.mdc`: Outlines the specific steps for adding new resources or gatherable nodes consistently.

As the project grows, more specific rules will be added for core features (e.g., crafting, building, combat) to ensure the AI can provide consistent and relevant assistance.

### Code Maintainability

While the project is still evolving, a key goal is maintainability. As features are added, we aim to:
*   Keep individual file sizes manageable (ideally under ~600 lines where practical).
*   Refactor logic into reusable helper functions and potentially dedicated modules (like the planned `inventory_logic.rs`).
*   Utilize abstraction to avoid code duplication, especially for common interactions like container management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Client Configuration

### Game Parameters (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`)

This file centralizes client-side values needed primarily for rendering the game world. 
The server uses its own authoritative values for game logic. Modifying these client values only affects local visuals.

*   `tileSize`: Visual pixel size for grid tiles.
*   `worldWidth`, `worldHeight`: Visual dimensions of the world grid (in tiles).
*   `spriteWidth`, `spriteHeight`: Pixel dimensions of a single sprite frame for rendering.

### SpacetimeDB Connection (`client/src/App.tsx`)

To connect the client to your SpacetimeDB instance, configure the following constants near the top of `client/src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS = 'ws://localhost:3000';
const SPACETIME_DB_NAME = 'vibe-survival-game';
```

*   **For Local Development:** Use the default values (`ws://localhost:3000` and your module name).
*   **For Maincloud Deployment:** Replace `SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS` with your Maincloud WebSocket URI (e.g., `wss://maincloud.spacetimedb.net`) and `SPACETIME_DB_NAME` with your Maincloud database name (e.g., `your-identity/your-database-name`).

## üåç World Configuration (Tile Size & Map Dimensions)

Changing the tile size or the overall world dimensions requires modifications in **both** the client and server code to ensure consistency between rendering, collision detection, and game logic.

1.  **Client (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`):**
    *   Modify the `TILE_SIZE` constant at the top of the file.
    *   **World Dimensions (in tiles):**
        *   `SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES`: This constant represents the assumed width of the server's world in tiles. It should match `WORLD_WIDTH_TILES` in `server/src/lib.rs`.
        *   `SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES`: This constant represents the assumed height of the server's world in tiles. It should match `WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` in `server/src/lib.rs`.
    *   **Visual/Legacy World Dimensions (in tiles):**
        *   The `worldWidth` and `worldHeight` properties within the exported `gameConfig` object are also present. Ensure these are consistent with `SERVER_WORLD_WIDTH_TILES` and `SERVER_WORLD_HEIGHT_TILES` respectively. These might be used for client-side rendering calculations that haven't been fully updated to use the `serverWorld...` prefixed variables.
        *   Other values like `minimapGridCellDiagonalTiles`
