## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Seamless player movement synchronization
- **Infinite World**: Procedurally generated, tile-based terrain with efficient rendering
- **Resource System**: Comprehensive inventory and collection mechanics
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation between client and server components
- **Performance Focused**: Built with optimization, extensibility, and good vibes in mind

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technologies                |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Frontend    | React 19, Vite 6, TypeScript |
| Multiplayer | SpacetimeDB                |
| Backend     | Rust (WebAssembly)         |
| Development | Node.js 22+                |

## ⚙️ Client Configuration

### Game Parameters (`client/src/config/gameConfig.ts`)

This file centralizes client-side values needed primarily for rendering the game world. 
The server uses its own authoritative values for game logic. Modifying these client values only affects local visuals.

*   `tileSize`: Visual pixel size for grid tiles.
*   `worldWidth`, `worldHeight`: Visual dimensions of the world grid (in tiles).
*   `spriteWidth`, `spriteHeight`: Pixel dimensions of a single sprite frame for rendering.

### SpacetimeDB Connection (`client/src/App.tsx`)

To connect the client to your SpacetimeDB instance, configure the following constants near the top of `client/src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS = 'ws://localhost:3000';
const SPACETIME_DB_NAME = 'vibe-survival-game';
```

*   **For Local Development:** Use the default values (`ws://localhost:3000` and your module name).
*   **For Maincloud Deployment:** Replace `SPACETIME_DB_ADDRESS` with your Maincloud WebSocket URI (e.g., `wss://maincloud.spacetimedb.net`) and `SPACETIME_DB_NAME` with your Maincloud database name (e.g., `your-identity/your-database-name`).

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

This guide assumes you have installed the prerequisites: Node.js v22+, Rust, and the SpacetimeDB CLI.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeloSlav/vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival.git
    cd vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-multiplayer-survival
    ```

2.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start Local SpacetimeDB Server:**
    Open a **separate terminal** window and run:
    ```bash
    spacetime start
    ```
    Keep this terminal running in the background. It hosts your local game database.

4.  **Build, Publish Server Module & Generate Client Bindings:**
    Open **another terminal** window, navigate to the `server` directory, and run these commands:
    ```bash
    cd server
    spacetime publish vibe-survival-game
    spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated
    ```
    *   **Note:** You need to re-run these two commands *every time* you change the server schema (e.g., modify tables or reducers in `server/src/lib.rs`).

5.  **Run the Client:**
    In the **same terminal** as step 4 (or a new one, just make sure you are in the project root directory `vibe-coding-starter-pack-2d-survival`), run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Access the Game:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Local Setup

*   **`Cannot find module './generated'` error in client:**
    *   Ensure you ran `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated` from the `server` directory *after* the last `spacetime publish`.
    *   Make sure the `client/src/generated` folder was actually created and contains `.ts` files.
    *   Restart the Vite dev server (`npm run dev`).
*   **Client connects but game doesn't load / players don't appear:**
    *   Check the browser console for errors (e.g., subscription failures).
    *   Check the terminal running `spacetime start` for server-side errors (e.g., reducer panics).
*   **Old players still appearing after disconnect/refresh:**
    *   The disconnect logic might not be removing them correctly. The most reliable way to ensure a clean state is to delete and recreate the local database:
        ```bash
        # Stop spacetime start (Ctrl+C)
        spacetime delete vibe-survival-game # Run from any directory
        spacetime start # Restart the server
        # Then re-publish and re-generate (Step 4 above)
        ```
*   **`spacetime publish` tries to publish to Maincloud instead of local:**
    *   Ensure you are logged out: `spacetime logout`.
    *   Ensure the `spacetime start` server is running *before* you publish.
    *   Check your SpacetimeDB config file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/SpacetimeDB/config/cli.toml` on Windows, `~/.local/share/spacetime/config/cli.toml` on Linux/macOS) and make sure `default_server` is set to `local` (or comment it out).

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Server Development**:
   - Modify Rust code in the `server/src` directory
   - Run `spacetime build` to compile changes
   - Generate updated TypeScript bindings: `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir ../client/src/generated`

2. **Client Development**:
   - Edit React components in `client/src`
   - The dev server supports hot module replacement

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- ✅ **Environment Systems**: Day/night cycle
- [ ] **Authentication/Account System**
- [ ] **Advanced AI**: Basic enemy behaviors and interaction patterns
- [ ] **Construction**: More base building (beyond campfire)
- ✅ **Placeables**: Campfire (Basic)
- ✅ **Survival Mechanics**: Basic resource harvesting (wood/stone)
- 🚧 **More Survival**: Hunger, Thirst, Warmth, Health, Death/Respawn (Partially done, needs more depth)
- [ ] **Competitive Elements**: PvP mechanics and team-based gameplay
- ✅ **World Discovery**: Minimap
- ✅ **Hotbar/Basic UI**: Basic functionality
- [ ] **Crafting/Items**: Crafting system, more item variety
