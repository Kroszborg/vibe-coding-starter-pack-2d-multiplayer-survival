Immediate Fixes:

1) Modify the client_disconnected handler:
Ensure it properly removes ALL references to a player
Add logging to confirm disconnections are fully processed
Check if any player remnants remain in other tables

2) Separate stat calculations from movement:
Move stats calculation to a separate reducer that runs on a timer
Only update stats every few seconds rather than on every movement

Medium-Term Solutions:

1) Add a proper scheduler system:
Implement a central game tick system rather than updating on player movement
Create schedule tables specifically for player stat updates
Similar to how the campfire fuel checks work in the code

2) Database maintenance reducer:
Create a periodic cleanup reducer that detects and removes orphaned entities
Run it automatically every few minutes

Long-Term Architectural Changes:

1) Redesign movement system:
Split movement input from physics/stats processing
Process player inputs and positions at a fixed rate
Implement proper delta-time handling

2) Implement client-side prediction:
Move more collision detection to the client
Let server validate and correct only when needed
