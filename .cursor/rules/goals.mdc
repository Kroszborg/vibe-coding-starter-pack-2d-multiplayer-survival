Short-Term Goals:

1) Separate stat calculations from movement and add a proper scheduler system:
Implement a central game tick system rather than updating on player movement
Create schedule tables specifically for player stat updates
Similar to how the campfire fuel checks work in the code

2) Database maintenance reducer:
Create a periodic cleanup reducer that detects and removes orphaned entities
Run it automatically every few minutes

Long-Term Architectural Changes:

1) Redesign movement system:
Process player inputs and positions at a fixed rate
Implement proper delta-time handling
